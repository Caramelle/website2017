title: The new website
author: qaisjp

Here at CompSoc we have the tradition of writing a brand new website almost
every year, and this year is no different.

From MediaWiki, to WordPress, to
[Django](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/website-django), and to Jekyll.
This is not the first time using Jekyll,
[last year's project](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/website2016) made
use of the nice Minimal Mistakes template. This year, however, we've rewritten
the whole thing from ground up, with the support of SIG: Web (and Bootstrap!)

We still have a couple ideas in the works, and we are always looking for your opinions
and suggestions, so please do
[share them](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/website2017/issues/new). You will
need a GitHub account to do this, so if you don't have one, definitely go ahead and
create one. Feel free to make a post on [our Facebook group](/community) if that works for you.

Hope all you lovely CompSoc-ers are having a great summer, whichever part of the world you're in. See you soon!
