# Contributing

- Commit messages: [please follow this guide](1)
- You agree that your code is to be licensed as per the repository license, as per the GitHub Terms of Service.
- Keep commits bite-sized. Try not to do too many things at once in one commit.

## tl;dr:

Fortunately, there are well-established conventions as to what makes an idiomatic Git commit message. Indeed, many of them are assumed in the way certain Git commands function. There’s nothing you need to re-invent. Just follow the seven rules below and you’re on your way to committing like a pro.

**The seven rules of a great Git commit message** - keep in mind: This has all been said before.

    1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    3. Capitalize the subject line
    4. Do not end the subject line with a period
    5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
    7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
