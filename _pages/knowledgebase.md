### Interested in becoming a programmer?

Becoming a programmer isn't something that can just be taught: you need to put a lot of your own personal time into it.

There are plenty of places where you can get help, and we're happy to answer [any questions](/community) you have:

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) has some excellent free courses for learning how to code. Great languages to start out with would be Python or JavaScript.
- [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/61oly8/new_read_me_first/) - a community on reddit

Even if you're a complete beginner you should come along to a couple of our events. We cover the wide range of Informatics and surrounding yourself with likeminded people is a great way to boost your interest in becoming a programmer. More resources to be added here soon...
