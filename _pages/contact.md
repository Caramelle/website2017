## Keeping up to date

We have a Facebook page with all our official announcements. [Give us a like.](https://fb.me/compsoc)

We also have two Facebook groups. The primary group is called "[CompSoc Members](https://facebook.com/groups/compsocedinburgh)", a group for anyone who would like to join the CompSoc community, whether or not you're actually a paying member.

If you're interested in job offers or other interesting deals, you should also join the second group, "[CompSoc Offers](https://facebook.com/groups/compsoc.offers)".

## Meet the community

We have more than just a Facebook group. We use IRC and Discord. Both are connected to each other, so feel free to join one rather than the other, or both!

For IRC, you do not need to register an account, [you can pop in right away](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.imaginarynet.uk:+6697#compsoc). Be patient, you won't see any messages prior to the time you joined.

For Discord, you are required to register an account, but it shows messages that were sent when you are offline. [Here is the invite link.](https://discord.gg/e4y8Vy5)

For more information about our IRC channels, visit [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/irc).
