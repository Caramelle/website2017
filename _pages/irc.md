To keep in touch online, we use IRC. We have multiple channels on ImaginaryNet, but our primary one is #compsoc.

A list of other channels can be found in the topic of the #compsoc channel.

If you already have an IRC client installed on your device, just [click here](ircs://irc.imaginarynet.uk/#compsoc) to join the server.

## Are you new to IRC?

The folks over at the [Tardis project](https://tardis.ed.ac.uk/) host a web client for you to use, called The Lounge (formerly _Shout_). First you need to [register for The Lounge](https://shout-register.tardis.ed.ac.uk/). Once you have done that, [you may log in here](https://shout.tardis.ed.ac.uk).
