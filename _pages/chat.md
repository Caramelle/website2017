CompSoc uses multiple platforms to allow you to chat with the community. All of these are connected to each other so that there is a single community.

At the moment we have Discord and IRC. We do have a Slack server, but we are still working on bridging Slack, so we'll share that later.

We have rooms for each of the areas that CompSoc focuses on (web development, cyber security, etc.), [Tardis](http://tardis.ed.ac.uk), and rooms for each of the academic years.

It's really worth joining the yearly rooms as they contain past lecturers, tutors and students who are often happy to lend a hand.
